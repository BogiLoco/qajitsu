# @qajitsu/adapter-publish-jira

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 322dcb3: New core package `@qajitsu/adapter-files` (REQ-GEN-11/AC1). It holds the adapters that work from local files: tickets
  and their workflow, the publisher and bug tracker that write files, resolved bugs for the knowledge base, and manual
  cases from CSV or Excel. They moved out of `ticket-jira`, `publish-jira` and `testcases`, which no longer export them,
  so those packages can become plugins while a project on files keeps working without any plugin. `@qajitsu/core` now
  exports the helpers these adapters share: `bugMarkdown`, `componentTag`, `toImportedCase` and `MAX_IMPORTED_CASES`.
- 44e4d71: Approval flow with model approvers (REQ-PLAN-10, ADR-0010): `approval.flow` lists person and model steps; a model
  approver (another model than the planner) approves, asks for a revision or hands over to a person, and code hands
  over plans with flagged values or open questions without asking it. Every decision is kept in `run.json`
  (`approvals`) and the journal with the plan, prompt and answer hashes; `qj approve --person` lets a person decide at
  once. Plans approved by a model only are marked in the matrix, report, junit and Jira comment, `approval.model_only:
  review` turns their PASSED into NEEDS_REVIEW, the `approval-intact` gate and `qj audit verify` check the records, and
  `approval.jira: comment` posts the plan and each decision as separate comments. The file publisher keeps named
  comments in their own files.
- 71f8b88: `qj bug <TICKET>`: reports FAILED cases as Jira bugs after showing similar open bugs; the report is rendered by code from the run (steps, expected vs actual, version, environment, evidence by hash, hint), masked, labelled `qajitsu` and linked to the tested ticket, or the failure is linked to an existing bug. New `BugTracker` interface with Jira (Cloud, Data Center) and file implementations.
- 2acbc70: Jira workflow: `workflow:` maps the team's statuses per role; `qj publish` moves the ticket by the computed result
  (all PASSED to "passed", FAILED back to the change's author, anything else stays in testing with a label);
  `qj workflow sync` takes plan approval from `/qj approve v<N>`, `/qj revise` and `/qj reject` comments by a Jira
  group with reminders; one active run per ticket and a daily limit; `qj doctor` checks the mapping. Also: cost per
  verified ticket with cache and dated prices, stage timing and budgets, plan quality, agent scorecard and `qj feedback`,
  prompt caching and input limits, the ticket readiness gate, and `qj reproduce` for certified runs.
  
  Tickets are picked up from the start status (`qj workflow poll`, `qj workflow serve` with a signed webhook).
  Certificates get trusted RFC 3161 timestamps (`certificate.timestamp`, `qj audit timestamp`, checked by
  `qj verify-report --tsa-ca` and `tools/verify-certificate.mjs`), and certified runs can be kept in write-once storage
  on S3 Object Lock (`archive`, new plugin `@qajitsu/adapter-evidence-s3`, `qj audit archive`); locked runs are kept by
  cleanup.
- 4acbbd3: Publishing to Jira (the result comment, attachments, bug reports, the workflow and attachment downloads for `qj pull`) is a plugin (REQ-GEN-11/AC1): `qj plugin add publish-jira`; `qj setup` installs it for a project with `jira.type: cloud` or `datacenter`. Publishing to files stays in the core. The CLI loads it on first use; the Publisher contract runs against the installed plugin.
- b447614: Stage 4: `qajitsu publish` recomputes statuses and gates from disk, shows a preview, then posts the results comment
  (ADF on Jira Cloud, wiki markup on Data Center) with the evidence zip and updates the same comment when a run is
  published again. Adds `qajitsu evidence` for local reproduction, the Jira Data Center ticket source and the
  `publish` configuration section. The `Publisher` interface now takes a rendered comment and returns a result with
  uploaded and skipped attachments.
- 76edd93: Stage 5: web and mixed tests. The trusted parent drives a Playwright browser for sandboxed specs (ADR-0004) with a
  screenshot per step, full-page screenshot, DOM, video and trace on failure, HAR and console per case; `ui.*` in the
  steps API and `elements`/`texts` expectations in plans; the healer limited to selectors and waits by an AST diff
  (healed passes are NEEDS_REVIEW); parallel workers; `qajitsu logs`, a timeline and a transition graph in report.html;
  `qajitsu evidence` opens the report, videos and traces; `qajitsu pull` downloads CI evidence from Jira; ffmpeg video
  compression before upload. `CaseRuntime.endStep`, `verify` and `finish` are now async.

### Patch Changes

- 8a03150: Onboarding through `.qa/` only: login scripts in `.qa/auth/` (`login: { script: auth/<file> }`) for form, cookie
  or SSO logins, and `hooks.setup` / `hooks.teardown` around every run (a failing setup makes every case BLOCKED).
  `mobile.devices` runs mobile cases on several emulators or farm sessions in parallel, one case at a time per
  device. Publishers honour an aborted signal before sending anything. `qj run` lists every configuration problem.
- 3ec9d51: The guard holds every plugin to its manifest (REQ-GEN-11/AC4+AC9, ADR-0015). `@qajitsu/guard` adds
  `checkPluginCode`. At install, and again before an installed plugin is loaded, the plugin's own code is checked
  against its permissions: Node's network, process and file modules, reads of `process.env` and the global `fetch`. A
  plugin that does more than it declares, or that refers to the frozen plan, is refused. Every HTTP call of an
  integration plugin goes through a guarded `fetch` that allows only its manifest's hosts and the URLs the project
  configures for it. Plugin manifests get the `environment` permission, and five manifests that understated their code
  are corrected.
- 1384f6e: Plugins installed on demand (REQ-GEN-11). `@qajitsu/core` adds `PLUGIN_API_VERSION`, `PLUGIN_TYPES`,
  `parsePluginManifest` and `PluginError`. Every adapter package now carries its plugin manifest under
  `qajitsu.plugin`. The CLI adds `qj plugin list|add|remove`, which installs the version a release pins from the npm
  registry, checked against its published checksum and without install scripts. `qj doctor` names missing plugins and
  `--fix` installs them, `qj setup` installs the plugins a project needs, runs record the plugin versions they used,
  and `qj knowledge` loads its stores and sources through the plugin loader.
